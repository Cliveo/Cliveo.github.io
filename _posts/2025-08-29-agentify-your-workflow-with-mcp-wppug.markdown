I recently presented at the Wellington Dynamics & Power Platform User Group with Rami Mounla and Inna Carp on how to "agentify" your workflow using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

If you're curious about building your own tools for agents or if existing MCP servers don't quite fit your needs, this session walks through creating a custom MCP server for the Dataverse WebAPI and shows real-world productivity wins. UI is slow, my MCP is fast. ðŸ˜„
